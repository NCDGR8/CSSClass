                <h1>Our materials</h1>
                <p>When designing new products, we look far and wide for the highest-quality fabrics. The twin pillars of longevity and sustainability are what we search for.</p>

                        <h3>Polycarbonate</h3>
                        <p>Polycarbonate is reputed for its impact-resistant qualities and versatility. The exteriors of our hard-shell travel cases are made from German-engineered Makrolon polycarbonate (100% virgin PC), a blue-chip provider.</p> 
    
                        <p> We use polycarbonate because it's inherently durable. Bumps on the road are inevitable when travelling with luggage, however, polycarbonate’s ability to absorb pressure and flex instead of breaking stands it in much better stead than other luggage materials.</p> 
                            
                        <p>The material is also visually sleek, lightweight and effortless to maintain. Dirt can be removed from its surface with just warm soapy water.</p>

                        <h3>Nylon</h3>
                        <p>Our Nylon is made from 100% recycled pre-consumer waste. This involves recycling nylon materials discarded in manufacturing processes to give them a new purpose. </p> 
    
                        <p>Along with its eco-friendly credentials, the material offers a high degree of water resistance, impressive strength-to-weight ratio and robustness. At the same time, the coarsely woven construction helps to conceal stains and blemishes. 
                        </p> 
                            
                        <p>Visually, the matte finish subtly elevates the appearance of our nylon bags, giving them a functional luxury look.</p>

                        <h3>Nubuck</h3>
                        <p>Nubuck is a type of full-grain leather that has been sanded down to give it a velvety, napped texture. It has a similar look and feel to suede yet is more long-lasting, as it’s made from the toughest part of the hide.</p> 
    
                        <p>Our raw hides are sourced from European cattle, so we have full traceability and are assured that the husbandry meets strict animal welfare standards.</p> 
                            
                        <p>The nubuck is given a 3M hydrophobic coating that adds a protective barrier to guard against stains, abrasion and the elements. It also simplifies the cleaning process and ensures a longer lifespan.</p>

                        <h3>Vachetta</h3>
                        <p>Vachetta leather is vegetable-tanned using organic tannins for a natural finish. This tanning process shuns the use of manmade chemicals — prevalent in worldwide leather production — that can adversely affect the environment if improperly treated. </p> 
    
                        <p>The raw hides are sourced from Scandinavian cattle, again, as byproducts of the meat & dairy industry. </p> 
                            
                        <p>Vachetta leather is reputed for its durability, buttery-smooth texture and ability to develop a rich patina over time. It’s the bedrock of our long-standing Heritage collection.</p>

                        <h3>Aluminium</h3>
                        <p>Aluminium is an inherently hardwearing and relatively lightweight metal. To increase their sturdiness, our hard-shell suitcases favour a hybrid construction that integrates polycarbonate shells with aluminium lock frames. </p>

                        <h3>Grainded Leather</h3>
                        <p>A full-grain, semi-aniline article with a subtle textured finish, our grained leather excels on both the durability and sustainability fronts.</p> 
    
                        <p>it’s sourced from Richard Hoffmans, a family-run German tannery dating back to the 19th century, now in its fifth generation of owners. Rated ‘Gold’ by the Leather Working Group for its industry-leading eco-credentials, the tannery has full traceability down to the individual hide.</p> 
                            
                        <p>The above ensures this grained leather compares favourably to industry standards for bovine leather, down 60% and 49% respectively on CO2 emissions and water consumption.</p>
